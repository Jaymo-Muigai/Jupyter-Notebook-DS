# Covid-19 Corona Virus Analysis
Analysis of COVID-19 based on number of confirmed, death and recovered cases captured every day across the globe (Data from OMS Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) daily situation reports).<br>
<br>
## Context
A new coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, after people developed pneumonia without a clear cause and for which existing vaccines or treatments were not effective. The virus has shown evidence of human-to-human transmission, and its transmission rate (rate of infection) appeared to escalate in mid-January 2020, with several countries across Europe, North America, and the Asia Pacific reporting cases.
As of 30 January 2020, approximately 8,243 cases have been confirmed, including in every province of China. The first confirmed death from the coronavirus infection occurred on 9 January and since then 170 deaths have been confirmed.
